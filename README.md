# Machine-Over-Heat-Detection
* Project Description:  This project will very beneficial especially in places like factories or industries consisting of big machines where it is very necessary to take some action in case the machine is overheated. Because in open eyes we don’t get it if our machines are over heated or not. It is important to keep the machine under maintenance weather it gets over heated. As a machine needs not to be over tempered to work efficiently. We need to keep tracking the current temperature of machines. Which we can’t get in open eyes. This hardware will help to know the current temperature of machines. It also will gives us a warning through sound and a red light. Which will warn us that the machine get overheated. 
* Software Requirements: Arduino IDE , Programming Language : C
* Hardware Requirements: Arduino Uno R3 , LM35 Temperature Sensor , 16*2 LCD , Jumper Wire , Voltage Regulator , Transformer 12V  , Breadboard.
